## Security Architecture Overview

### Core Security Principles

DaemonEye is built on fundamental security principles that guide every aspect of its design and implementation:

**Principle of Least Privilege**: Each component operates with the minimum privileges required for its specific function, with immediate privilege dropping after initialization.

**Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls protect against various attack vectors, from memory safety to network isolation.

**Fail-Safe Design**: The system fails securely, maintaining monitoring capabilities even when individual components experience issues.

**Audit-First Approach**: All security-relevant events are cryptographically logged with tamper-evident integrity guarantees.

**Zero Trust Architecture**: No component trusts another without explicit verification, and all communications are authenticated and encrypted.

3. **IPC Communication Attacks**: Exploitation of inter-process communication
4. **Database Tampering**: Attempts to modify stored process data or audit logs
5. **Privilege Escalation**: Exploitation of temporary elevated privileges
6. **Network-based Attacks**: Exploitation of alert delivery channels

### Security Boundary Enforcement

**Process Isolation**:

## US Government ISSO Considerations

This section explains how DaemonEye addresses specific concerns and requirements that US Government Information System Security Officers (ISSOs) must consider when evaluating security monitoring solutions for federal systems.

### What DaemonEye Provides for ISSOs

**Audit-Grade Evidence Collection**:

DaemonEye's Merkle tree audit ledger provides cryptographically verifiable evidence that ISSOs can use for compliance reporting and forensic investigations. The system generates inclusion proofs for every audit event, enabling ISSOs to demonstrate data integrity and non-repudiation to auditors and investigators.

**Minimal Attack Surface for High-Risk Environments**:

The three-component architecture with privilege separation means that even if one component is compromised, the system maintains security boundaries. This is particularly important for ISSOs managing systems with sensitive data, as it limits the blast radius of potential security incidents.

**Airgapped Operation Capability**:

DaemonEye operates entirely offline, making it suitable for classified environments where network connectivity is restricted. ISSOs can deploy the system in airgapped networks without compromising security or functionality.

### FISMA Compliance Support

**NIST SP 800-53 Control Implementation**:

DaemonEye directly implements several NIST SP 800-53 controls that ISSOs must verify:

- **AU-2 (Audit Events)**: Comprehensive logging of all security-relevant events with structured JSON format

- **AU-10 (Non-Repudiation)**: Merkle tree audit ledger provides cryptographic proof of data integrity
- **SI-4 (Information System Monitoring)**: Continuous process monitoring with real-time threat detection
- **SC-7 (Boundary Protection)**: Outbound-only network connections with no listening ports
- **AC-6 (Least Privilege)**: Minimal privilege implementation with immediate privilege dropping

**Evidence for ATO Packages**:

The system generates the audit evidence and documentation that ISSOs need for Authorization to Operate (ATO) packages, including:

- Cryptographic integrity verification reports
- Privilege separation documentation
- Input validation test results
- Performance benchmarks under load

## Footnotes

## Conclusion

DaemonEye's security design provides a comprehensive framework for secure process monitoring and threat detection. The three-component architecture with strict privilege separation, cryptographic integrity verification, and comprehensive audit logging ensures that the system meets enterprise security requirements while maintaining high performance and operational efficiency.

The system's defense-in-depth approach, combined with its air-gap compatibility and compliance features, makes it suitable for deployment in high-security environments where traditional monitoring solutions may not meet security requirements.
