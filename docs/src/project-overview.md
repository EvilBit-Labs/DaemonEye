# SentinelD Project Overview

## Mission Statement

SentinelD is a security-focused, high-performance process monitoring system designed to detect suspicious activity on systems through continuous process monitoring, behavioral analysis, and pattern recognition. **Its primary purpose is to detect suspicious activity on systems by monitoring abnormal process behavior and patterns.**

This is a complete Rust 2024 rewrite of a proven Python prototype, delivering enterprise-grade performance with audit-grade integrity while maintaining the security-first, offline-capable philosophy.

## Core Mission

Detect and alert on suspicious system activity through continuous process monitoring, behavioral analysis, and pattern recognition. Provide security operations teams with a reliable, high-performance threat detection solution that operates independently of external dependencies while maintaining audit-grade integrity and operator-centric workflows.

## Three-Component Architecture

SentinelD implements a **three-component security architecture** with strict privilege separation:

### 1. **procmond** (Privileged Process Collector)

- **Purpose**: Minimal privileged component for secure process data collection
- **Security**: Runs with elevated privileges, drops them immediately after initialization
- **Network**: No network access whatsoever
- **Database**: Write-only access to audit ledger
- **Features**: Process enumeration, executable hashing, Certificate Transparency-style audit ledger

### 2. **sentinelagent** (Detection Orchestrator)

- **Purpose**: User-space detection rule execution and alert management
- **Security**: Minimal privileges, outbound-only network connections
- **Database**: Read/write access to event store
- **Features**: SQL-based detection engine, multi-channel alerting, procmond lifecycle management

### 3. **sentinelcli** (Operator Interface)

- **Purpose**: Command-line interface for queries, management, and diagnostics
- **Security**: No network access, read-only database operations
- **Features**: JSON/table output, color handling, shell completions, system health monitoring

### 4. **sentinel-lib** (Shared Core)

- **Purpose**: Common functionality shared across all components
- **Modules**: config, models, storage, detection, alerting, crypto, telemetry
- **Security**: Trait-based abstractions with security boundaries
