# DaemonEye Technical Stack

## Language & Runtime

- **Language**: Rust 2024 Edition (MSRV: 1.85+)
- **Safety**: `unsafe_code = "forbid"` at workspace level

## Build System & Commands

### Task Runner (justfile)

```bash
# Development workflow
just fmt          # Format code with rustfmt
just lint         # Run clippy with strict warnings (-D warnings)
just test         # Run all tests with cargo-nextest (unit + integration)
just build        # Build entire workspace

# Testing variants
just test-unit    # Run unit tests only
just test-integration  # Run integration tests only
just test-fuzz    # Run fuzz testing suite
just coverage     # Generate coverage report with tarpaulin

# Component execution
just run-procmond --once --verbose      # Run process monitor
just run-daemoneye-cli --help             # Run CLI interface
just run-daemoneye-agent --config /path   # Run orchestrator agent
```

### Build Configuration

- **Profile**: Release builds with LTO, single codegen unit, stripped symbols
- **Cross-platform**: Static binaries with embedded SQLite
- **Packaging**: Platform-specific service files (systemd, launchd, Windows Service)

## Performance Requirements

- **CPU Usage**: \<5% sustained during continuous monitoring
- **Memory Usage**: \<100MB resident under normal operation
- **Process Enumeration**: \<5 seconds for 10,000+ processes
- **Database Operations**: >1,000 records/second write rate
- **Alert Latency**: \<100ms per detection rule execution

## Security Architecture

### SQL-to-IPC Architecture

- **Detection Rule Processing**: SQL detection rules are never executed directly against live processes
- **AST Analysis**: sqlparser extracts collection requirements from SQL AST to generate protobuf tasks
- **Task Translation**: daemoneye-agent translates complex SQL queries into simple collection tasks for procmond
- **Overcollection Strategy**: procmond may overcollect data due to granularity limitations, then SQL runs against stored data
- **Privilege Separation**: Only procmond touches live processes; SQL execution remains in userspace
- **Query Validation**: Only SELECT statements with approved functions allowed in detection engine
- **Prepared Statements**: All database queries use parameterized statements only

### Cryptographic Components

- **Audit Ledger**: Certificate Transparency-style append-only log with Merkle tree structure
- **Hashing**: BLAKE3 for fast cryptographic hashing and Merkle tree construction
- **Merkle Trees**: `rs-merkle` for efficient inclusion/exclusion proofs and batch verification
- **Signatures**: Optional Ed25519 for audit entry signing and periodic root hash attestation
- **Integrity**: HMAC for message authentication and tamper detection
- **Verification**: Logarithmic proof sizes for efficient audit trail validation
- **Airgap Support**: Periodic root hash checkpoints for manual external verification

### Resource Management

- **Bounded Channels**: Configurable capacity with backpressure policies
- **Memory Limits**: Cooperative yielding and memory budget enforcement
- **Timeout Support**: Cancellation tokens for graceful shutdown
- **Circuit Breakers**: Reliability patterns for external dependencies

[^5]: Windows 10: EOL October 14, 2025. Organizations should plan migration to Windows 11.

[^6]: Windows Server 2019: EOL January 9, 2029. Consider upgrading to Windows Server 2022.

[^1]: Ubuntu 18.04 (EOL April 2023): Legacy support for long-lived server deployments. Limited testing and no guaranteed compatibility.

[^8]: **Enterprise Tier**: No eBPF kernel monitoring (requires kernel 5.4+). Graceful degradation to userspace monitoring with reduced threat detection capabilities.

[^2]: RHEL 7 (EOL June 2024): Enterprise legacy support for organizations with extended support contracts. Compatibility not guaranteed.

[^7]: macOS 12.0 (Monterey): EOL September 16, 2024. Legacy support for organizations with older Mac hardware. **Enterprise Tier**: Limited EndpointSecurity framework features compared to macOS 14.0+. Reduced code signing bypass detection and advanced threat monitoring capabilities.

[^9]: **FreeBSD 13.0+**: pfSense/OPNsense ecosystem support. **Enterprise Tier**: No eBPF kernel monitoring (FreeBSD uses classic BPF). Full process and network monitoring via sysinfo crate and FreeBSD audit system.
