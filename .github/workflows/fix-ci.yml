          The GitHub CLI is available as `gh` and authenticated via `GH_TOKEN`. You can read repository contents and comment on pull requests, but you CANNOT create branches, push commits, or modify repository contents.

          # Context:
          - Repo: ${{ github.repository }}
          - Owner: ${{ github.repository_owner }}
          - Workflow Run ID: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.id }}
          - Workflow Run URL: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.html_url }}

          # Goal:
          - Analyze the CI failure and generate a suggested fix without making any repository changes.

          # Requirements:
          1) Identify the PR associated with the failed workflow run and determine the failure cause.
          2) Generate a patch file with the suggested fix (use \`git diff\` format).
          3) Post a single PR comment explaining the suggested fix and providing a download link for the patch.
          4) Do NOT create branches, push commits, or modify any repository contents.

          # Deliverables:
          - A patch file saved as \`suggested-fix.patch\` in the runner workspace
          - A single PR comment with:
            * Brief explanation of the CI failure
            * Description of the suggested fix
            * Instructions for maintainer to apply the patch
            * Link to download the patch file

          # Safety constraints:
          - NO git push operations
          - NO branch creation
          - NO repository modifications
          - Only read access to repository contents
          - Generate patch files for human review and approval
