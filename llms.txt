# DaemonEye

> Security-focused, privilege-separated process monitoring system with SQL-driven detection, tamper-evident audit logging, and cross-platform support built in Rust

DaemonEye implements a three-component architecture (procmond, daemoneye-agent, daemoneye-cli) with strict privilege separation. This index provides AI assistants with normative specifications, development guidelines, and operational patterns. Start with Documentation for orientation, then Specifications for requirements, and Configuration for implementation guidance.
