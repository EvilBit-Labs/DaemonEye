# DaemonEye

> Security-focused, privilege-separated process monitoring and detection system providing process collection, SQL-driven detection rules, and tamper-evident audit logging.

DaemonEye implements a three-component architecture (`procmond`, `daemoneye-agent`, `daemoneye-cli`) with strict privilege separation and a shared core library. Use this index to locate normative specifications, core conceptual docs, and operational guidance. Prefer Documentation first for orientation; Specifications define authoritative requirements and limits; Configuration covers install/deploy/hardening guidance.
