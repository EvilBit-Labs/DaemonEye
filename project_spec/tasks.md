## Conclusion

This task breakdown provides a comprehensive roadmap from MVP to production-ready release. Each milestone builds incrementally on previous work while maintaining security, performance, and reliability focus throughout development.

The prioritization ensures that core security boundaries and performance targets are established early, with advanced platform features added in later phases. Risk mitigation strategies address the most critical technical and project risks that could impact timeline or security posture.

Regular milestone reviews and metric validation will ensure the project stays on track to deliver a production-ready security monitoring solution that meets the needs of SOC analysts, security operators, and infrastructure teams.
