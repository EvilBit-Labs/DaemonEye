## Future Collector Extensions (Strategic Roadmap)

The following collectors are planned for future implementation to extend the virtual table system:

- [ ] 13. Network Collector (netmond) - Virtual tables: `network_connections`, `network_interfaces`
- [ ] 14. Filesystem Collector (fsmond) - Virtual tables: `file_events`, `file_metadata`
- [ ] 15. Performance Collector (perfmond) - Virtual tables: `system_metrics`, `resource_usage`

These extensions will follow the established collector-core framework patterns and integrate with the SQL-to-IPC translation system for unified querying across all monitoring domains.

## Spec Coordination Strategy

This specification focuses on **core monitoring infrastructure** that is independent of the SQL-to-IPC detection engine. The two specs are designed to work together with clear boundaries:

### DaemonEye Core Monitoring (This Spec)

**Scope**: Infrastructure, process collection, service management, CLI, alerting, observability

- ✅ **Independent Tasks**: Can be implemented without SQL-to-IPC engine
- 🚧 **Placeholder Tasks**: Require SQL-to-IPC engine completion first

### SQL-to-IPC Detection Engine (Separate Spec)

**Scope**: SQL parsing, query optimization, reactive orchestration, specialty collectors

- 📍 **Location**: `.kiro/specs/sql-to-ipc-detection-engine/`
- 🎯 **Focus**: Complete detection engine architecture and implementation

### Implementation Workflow

1. **Phase 1**: Complete independent tasks in this spec (Tasks 1-5, 7-10)
2. **Phase 2**: Complete SQL-to-IPC detection engine spec entirely
3. **Phase 3**: Return to complete placeholder tasks (Tasks 6, 11, 12)
4. **Phase 4**: Integration testing and system validation

### Integration Points

- **Task 6**: SQL-to-IPC engine integration with daemoneye-agent
- **Task 11**: Specialty collectors integration with collector-core
- **Task 12**: Error handling integration across all components

This approach ensures:

- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Parallel development capability
- ✅ No duplication between specs
- ✅ Clear dependency management
- ✅ Focused implementation guidance
