# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing Enterprise tier features for SentinelD, targeting SOCs, IR teams, and industrial/government environments that require advanced process visibility, fleet monitoring, and enterprise-grade security features. The Enterprise tier builds upon the Business tier to provide kernel-level visibility, centralized fleet management, advanced SIEM integrations, and hardened security features suitable for critical infrastructure and compliance-sensitive environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a SOC analyst, I want real-time kernel-level visibility with event subscription across all supported platforms, so that I can detect sophisticated attacks in real-time without the latency and overhead of polling-based monitoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on Linux with eBPF support THEN the system SHALL subscribe to real-time process creation, termination, and syscall events through eBPF programs
2. WHEN running on Windows THEN the system SHALL subscribe to real-time ETW events for process lifecycle, registry modifications, and file system changes
3. WHEN running on macOS THEN the system SHALL subscribe to real-time EndpointSecurity events for process execution, file system activity, and network connections
4. WHEN kernel events are received THEN the system SHALL process them with sub-millisecond latency from event occurrence to detection rule evaluation
5. WHEN real-time event subscription is active THEN the system SHALL eliminate polling overhead and provide continuous monitoring without periodic scans
6. WHEN kernel-level monitoring is not available THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to userspace polling-based monitoring without service interruption
7. WHEN kernel events are captured THEN the system SHALL correlate them with userspace events to provide complete process lifecycle visibility
8. WHEN syscall tracing is enabled THEN the system SHALL monitor security-relevant system calls (execve, fork, clone, ptrace, mmap) in real-time
9. IF the system lacks required kernel monitoring privileges THEN the system SHALL log appropriate warnings and continue with available monitoring capabilities
10. WHEN cross-platform deployments are active THEN the system SHALL normalize real-time events from different platforms into a unified data model

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security operations manager, I want a federated Security Center architecture for large-scale fleet monitoring, so that I can efficiently manage thousands of endpoints across multiple geographic locations and network segments with hierarchical data aggregation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple SentinelD agents are deployed THEN they SHALL connect to regional Security Center collectors for initial data aggregation
2. WHEN regional Security Centers are deployed THEN they SHALL act as store-and-forward proxies to higher-tier Security Centers or the primary Security Center

4. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN agents and regional Security Centers SHALL buffer events locally and resume transmission when connectivity is restored
5. WHEN a Security Center receives events THEN it SHALL deduplicate, normalize, and optionally filter data before forwarding to the next tier
6. WHEN fleet-wide queries are executed THEN the system SHALL distribute queries through the hierarchy and aggregate results within 60 seconds for up to 10,000 endpoints
7. WHEN regional Security Centers are configured THEN they SHALL provide local query capabilities for their managed endpoints without requiring connectivity to higher tiers
8. WHEN hierarchical deployment is active THEN the system SHALL support at least 3 tiers: agents → regional collectors → primary Security Center
9. IF a regional Security Center fails THEN agents SHALL automatically failover to backup collectors or connect directly to higher-tier Security Centers
