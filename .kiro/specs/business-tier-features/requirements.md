# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Business Tier Features specification defines the enhanced capabilities that differentiate the Business tier ($199/site) from the Free tier of SentinelD. These features target small teams and consultancies who need professional-grade monitoring with enhanced integrations, curated rule packs, and deployment-ready packages. The business tier maintains the core offline-first philosophy while adding polish and enterprise integrations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security consultant, I want access to curated rule packs for common threat patterns, so that I can deploy effective monitoring without having to research and write detection rules from scratch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL load curated rule packs for malware TTPs, suspicious parent/child relationships, and process hollowing detection
2. WHEN a rule pack is updated THEN the system SHALL validate rule syntax and compatibility before activation
3. WHEN multiple rule packs are installed THEN the system SHALL prevent rule conflicts and provide clear precedence ordering
4. IF a rule pack contains invalid SQL THEN the system SHALL reject the pack and log detailed validation errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a SOC analyst, I want to send alerts to enterprise SIEM platforms like Splunk and Elastic, so that I can integrate process monitoring into our existing security infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an alert is triggered THEN the system SHALL support delivery via Splunk HEC, Elasticsearch REST API, and Kafka topics
2. WHEN configuring output connectors THEN the system SHALL validate connection parameters and authentication credentials
3. WHEN a connector fails THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff and circuit breaker patterns
4. WHEN multiple connectors are configured THEN the system SHALL deliver alerts to all active connectors simultaneously

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want container and Kubernetes deployment options, so that I can deploy SentinelD in containerized environments with proper orchestration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to Kubernetes THEN the system SHALL provide DaemonSet manifests with proper RBAC and security contexts
2. WHEN running in containers THEN the system SHALL support volume mounts for configuration and persistent storage
3. WHEN deployed as a DaemonSet THEN each node SHALL run an independent instance with local data collection
4. IF container privileges are insufficient THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade and log capability limitations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want to export detection data in standard formats like CEF, JSON, and STIX-lite, so that I can integrate with various security tools and threat intelligence platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL support CEF (Common Event Format), structured JSON, and STIX-lite formats
2. WHEN generating CEF output THEN the system SHALL map process events to appropriate CEF fields with correct severity levels
3. WHEN creating STIX-lite exports THEN the system SHALL generate valid STIX objects for observed processes and relationships
4. WHEN exporting large datasets THEN the system SHALL support streaming exports to prevent memory exhaustion

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an IT administrator, I want signed installers for Windows and macOS, so that I can deploy SentinelD in enterprise environments with code signing requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building Windows packages THEN the system SHALL generate MSI installers signed with valid code signing certificates
2. WHEN building macOS packages THEN the system SHALL generate DMG installers with Apple Developer ID signatures
3. WHEN installing signed packages THEN the system SHALL pass operating system security validation without warnings
4. WHEN packages are distributed THEN they SHALL include proper metadata for enterprise deployment tools

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security operations manager, I want a central SentinelD Security Center server, so that I can aggregate data and configuration from multiple SentinelD agents across my infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Security Center starts THEN it SHALL accept secure connections from multiple sentinelagent instances
2. WHEN agents connect to the Security Center THEN they SHALL authenticate using mutual TLS with certificate validation
3. WHEN receiving data from agents THEN the Security Center SHALL aggregate alerts, process snapshots, and audit logs in a central database
4. WHEN agents disconnect THEN the Security Center SHALL maintain historical data and track agent connectivity status
5. WHEN configuring detection rules THEN the Security Center SHALL distribute rule updates to connected agents
6. IF the Security Center becomes unavailable THEN agents SHALL continue operating independently with local storage

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a small business owner, I want an optional GUI frontend for the Security Center, so that non-technical staff can monitor fleet status and view alerts without using command-line tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GUI is installed THEN it SHALL provide real-time dashboard views of fleet-wide system status and recent alerts
2. WHEN viewing alerts in the GUI THEN users SHALL be able to filter, sort, and export alert data across all connected agents
3. WHEN the GUI connects to the Security Center THEN it SHALL authenticate using secure web-based authentication
4. IF the GUI loses connection THEN it SHALL display connection status and attempt automatic reconnection
5. WHEN viewing agent status THEN the GUI SHALL show connectivity, health metrics, and last-seen timestamps for each agent

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a security operations manager, I want licensing that works offline without license servers, so that I can deploy in air-gapped environments while maintaining compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN activating business tier features THEN the system SHALL validate licenses using offline cryptographic verification
2. WHEN a license expires THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to free tier functionality with appropriate notifications
3. WHEN transferring licenses THEN the system SHALL support license deactivation and reactivation on different systems
4. IF license validation fails THEN the system SHALL continue operating in free tier mode without service interruption

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want enhanced configuration management for business features, so that I can deploy consistent configurations across multiple client environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring business features THEN the system SHALL support configuration templates and inheritance
2. WHEN validating business tier configurations THEN the system SHALL provide detailed validation with specific error messages
3. WHEN deploying configurations THEN the system SHALL support configuration signing and integrity verification
4. WHEN configuration conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear resolution guidance and safe fallback options
